  <h2>Artifact 3</h2>
  <h3><a href="https://student.schoolai.com/student-space?code=YC66" target="_blank">Learning Machine Learning via a Custom-Made Chatbox</a></h3>
  <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> This artifact illustrates how I used a customized chatbot which is developed by my instructor to understand machine learning training methods in an engaging and interactive way. It demonstrates how complex concepts can be demystified through conversational learning and self-guided inquiry.</p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong> By interacting with a specially designed AI chatbot, I explored foundational topics in machine learning such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. The chatbot served as a knowledgeable guide, responding to my structured questions and offering personalized explanations that helped me build a cohesive understanding of how different models are trained and optimized. This approach transformed abstract theory into tangible learning moments through dialogue.</p>

  <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To showcase how AI-powered tools like chatbots can make technical learning more approachable, and to document my learning journey in mastering core machine learning training concepts through conversational exploration.</p>

  <p><strong>Process:</strong> I began with a list of key questions—such as how supervised learning models are trained or how algorithms impact training processes—and posed them sequentially to the chatbot. As I received responses, I reflected, synthesized the information, and adapted my follow-up questions to deepen understanding. This iterative Q&A approach led to a meaningful and personalized learning experience that mimicked human tutoring.</p>

  <p><strong>Tools/Technologies Used:</strong> Instructor-developed AI chatbot hosted on SchoolAI platform; web-based interaction through browser interface</p>

  <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> This artifact demonstrates the power of adaptive learning through AI. It provides a compelling example of how educators can design guided chatbot interactions to enhance student comprehension, especially for complex, multi-layered subjects like machine learning. For learners, it offers a model of active, question-driven engagement—showing that even technical material becomes digestible when explored through personalized, conversational scaffolding.</p>

  <h4>Reflections from Interactive Learning</h4>

  <p><strong>What I Learned About Machine Learning Training Methods</strong><br>
  Through my dialogue with the chatbot, I developed a practical understanding of how machine learning models are trained. I learned that supervised learning depends on labeled datasets where models map inputs to known outputs; unsupervised learning finds patterns or clusters in unlabeled data; and reinforcement learning teaches agents through feedback from rewards and penalties. I also explored the vital role of algorithms, such as gradient descent, in optimizing models by adjusting their parameters over time.</p>

  <p>I discovered that training a machine learning model involves several essential steps: data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation. Repetition—through epochs and batch learning—enables the model to generalize better from examples and improve performance with each pass. These concepts, once intimidating, became much clearer through interactive explanation.</p>

  <p><strong>How I Used the Chatbot to Learn</strong><br>
  The chatbot served as both a mentor and a thought partner. I initiated the session with specific questions and followed up based on the responses I received. For instance, after asking about supervised learning, I naturally moved on to unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning, deepening my understanding with each step. The chatbot offered simplified language and real-world analogies that made abstract ideas much easier to grasp.</p>

  <p>More than just a question-answer tool, the chatbot helped me actively construct knowledge. By reflecting on its responses, I built connections between different learning paradigms and better understood how models are trained in practical settings. This method empowered me to take ownership of the learning process and encouraged deeper curiosity—something that static reading materials alone couldn’t provide.</p>

  <h2>Artifact 4</h2>
  <h3><a href="https://student.schoolai.com/student-space?code=0UBU" target="_blank">Approaches to Data Processing and Cleaning in Machine Learning</a></h3>

  <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> This artifact presents what I learned about essential practices in data processing and cleaning in machine learning applications. It demonstrates how interacting with an AI chatbot—the Data Challenge Scenarios Coach—allowed me to strengthen my understanding of how data quality directly impacts model performance.</p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong> Through guided dialogue with the chatbot, I explored how missing values, outliers, and class imbalance affect model performance, and reviewed standard methods for handling them. The artifact highlights the importance of making careful decisions during preprocessing to ensure models learn effectively from the data provided.</p>

  <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To document my learning about data preprocessing techniques in machine learning, and to illustrate how conversational engagement with the Data Challenge Scenarios Coach can be used as a dynamic learning tool for building technical skills.</p>

  <p><strong>Process:</strong> I accessed the Data Challenge Scenarios Coach using a link provided by my instructor. The chatbot guided me through three scenarios where I needed to make decisions about training methods, share my reasoning, and reflect on trade-offs. For example, I worked through scenarios on handling missing values in student test data, addressing extreme outliers in transaction datasets, and managing class imbalance in loan approval predictions. For each scenario, the bot explained multiple approaches and implications. This iterative process of inquiry and reflection helped me connect technical steps to practical decision-making in machine learning workflows.</p>

  <p><strong>Tools/Technologies Used:</strong> Data Challenge Scenarios Coach (AI chatbot), web-based interaction platform, structured Q&A approach for scenario exploration.</p>

  <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> This artifact emphasizes the importance of strong data preprocessing in machine learning. For practitioners, it provides practical insights into managing messy, imbalanced, or extreme-value datasets. It showcases how conversational AI can support self-directed learning by making complex trade-offs explicit and by encouraging critical thinking about model preparation. By bridging technical detail with scenario-based learning, the artifact offers a holistic experience that strengthens both understanding and application of data processing concepts.</p>

  <h4>Reflections from Interactive Learning</h4>

  <p><strong>What I Learned About Data Processing</strong><br>
  From the scenarios, I learned how preprocessing steps—like imputing missing values, transforming outliers, or rebalancing imbalanced data—directly affect model reliability and fairness. I gained a clearer understanding of how these choices influence the overall performance and interpretability of machine learning models. This perspective highlighted the importance of carefully evaluating preprocessing decisions instead of relying on a single standard approach.</p>

  <p><strong>How I Used the Chatbot to Learn</strong><br>
  The chatbot acted as a coach, presenting both straightforward and nuanced answers. I guided the learning by posing practical scenarios and then deepened my understanding by asking follow-up questions about trade-offs and implications. This active engagement helped me link preprocessing techniques to broader themes of effective model building. The process mirrored a real-world data science workflow: encountering messy data, testing different solutions, and weighing trade-offs. Through conversational exploration, I built a clearer framework for handling technical challenges in data preparation.</p>
